IDAS_WORKSHOP_2014 [WORK IN PROGRESS]
==================

Prototyping with Creative Coding Workshop Syllabus
================

A "syllabus" and repository of p5 examples for IDAS Winter workshop for **beginners** about creative coding and practical coding. The workshop will focus on students being able to understand and independently make simple code-based prototypes. The results could be and are not limited to **graphical interactions, web-based interactions, Creative Media Art**, and etc..., but all depends on the **studentâ€™s willingness to explore!**
Purpose is to familiarize students with coding as a creative discipline. And letting them play with coding as a means for lateral thinking. 
Let's get our hands dirty!
