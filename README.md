IDAS_WORKSHOP_2014
==================

Prototyping with Creative Coding Workshop Syllabus
================

A "syllabus" and repository of p5 examples for IDAS Winter workshop for **beginners** about creative coding and practical coding. The workshop will focus on students being able to understand and independently make simple code-based prototypes. The results could be and are not limited to **graphical interactions, web-based interactions, Creative Media Art**, and etc..., but all depends on the **studentâ€™s willingness to explore!**
Purpose is to familiarize students with coding as a creative discipline. And letting them play with coding as a means for lateral thinking. 
Let's get our hands dirty!


# Day 1, 10AM-5PM

## 10:00 AM - Overview of day
* What is Creative Coding? : "Technology is all around us" says anyone living today. There is value in creating digital content and technologists are on top of this value pyramid. However, being a technologist is not limited to engineers, it is a skillset that can be picked up by anyone and a skillset everyone should have. Computer programming is a skillset that is in the center of all this. Creative coding is an approachable way to learn this modern language for everyone. Not only is creative coding a way to learn programming, but a methodology to design emergent solutions to simple problems large corporations can not tackle.
* Basics of Coding : Coding is a manner of speaking. It is an international language in our modern age. Programming is at the heart of computer driven communities, which basically means everything today. Simply put, programming is a communication method for human to computer interactions.
* Making Interactions : Computers are interactive in its artificial nature, therefore coding, the communication tool, is interactive. Creative coding is making interaction more down to earth. A humanizing method for expression and communication what is essentially between human and human.
