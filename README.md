IDAS_WORKSHOP_2014
==================

Prototyping with Creative Coding Workshop Syllabus
================

A "syllabus" and repository of p5 examples for IDAS Winter workshop for **beginners** about creative coding and pratical coding. The workshop will focus on students being able to understand and independently make simple code-based prototypes. The results could be and are not limited to **graphical interfaces**, **web-based interactive apps**, **Coded Media Art**, and etc...

Purpose is to familiarize students with coding as a creative discipline. And letting them play with coding as a means for lateral thinking. 

Let's get our hands dirty!
